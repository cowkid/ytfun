 HI! Welcome to YTfun the best, most responive, duckduckgo proxy! Unblock YouTube videos using duckduckgo at school, work, or where ever you wish! It is so easy to use, that you will know what kind of $hit this is right of the bat! A duckduckgo page will apper slightly to the right, so scroll over and down to access it. Search a youtube video, then select a vdeo, or scroll over to find others. When you click a video for the first time, a massige to watch it on youtube, or to watch it here will pop up. **MAKE SURE YOU CLICK WATCH IT HERE, OR THE PROXY WILL NOT WORK!** No video pop up? Click the video tab and some videos should pop up. Questions? Concerns? Post them in the issues page on the official github page (https://github.com/cowkid/ytfun). Good luck, and have fun. Here is a small sample of the code to branch off of for all of you that want to fork this ;)
